1. ABOUT WINDOWGRAB ~
                                                             *windowgrab-about*

A window swapper copied from `wesQ3`'s WindowSwap.vim, but with modified UX.

Like WindowSwap, this plugin's purpose is to help with arbirary window swaps
that preserve your layout. However, WindowSwap only handles swaps; often what
I want to do is *move* a window. This is useful in situations where I am
diving through many files and finally find a file that is important; I want to
be able to move the file I found to a better place in my layout.

WindowGrab helps you grab your buffers between existing split windows without
affecting your current split layout.

All credit to `wesQ3` and `sgriffin` for the core implementation.

3. KEY MAPPINGS ~
                                  *windowgrab-keymappings* *windowgrab-functions*

First of all, you can prevent these default bindings by setting
`g:windowgrab_map_keys` to `0` in your `.vimrc`.

*WindowGrab#DoWindowGrab*                                  `<leader>c`
Mark current window if none is marked, swap current window with marked window
if mark is currently set. Clears marked window flag after swapping.

*WindowGrab#MoveWindow*                                    `<leader>v`
Moves the grabbed window to the current window, closing the original. If mark
is not set, does nothing.

*g:windowgrab_map_keys*                               default: `1`
Allow WindowGrab to map its default keys. Set to `0` to prevent any key
mappings.
